# R E I S
The purpose of REIS is to solve the problem of having a travel Diary. Every year we take acouple of trip to places that we love. Imagine being able to log everything you did through notes and pictures. Thats where REIS comes in, REIS makes it easy for yu to store all of your memories in one simple place. 

REIS allows you to add a destination to your list. Later on I will be implimenting a feature where you will be able to add photos and videos as well as likes in to a specific trip.
